You should seek the advice of Ken Nugent, if you have been injured. The amount of care and compensation you deserve as a result of your injury may be determined right after a swift report on your case from the Law Offices of Ken Nugent. Insurers understand their responsibilities to accident victims. But, they obtain the leeway to deny claims because they already know that many people in the general public are not aware of these responsibilities.</p>
